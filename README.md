### Hi there, I'm othaime-en ðŸ‘‹

:smiley: I'm a web3 and cybersecurity enthusiast who is here to learn and have fun while doing it.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on both spaces and learning a tonne of stuff too.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to any collaboration in building DAPPs, auditing them for vulnerabilities and anything security related (both web2 and web3)

:rocket: I'm obsessed with astronomy and space exploration so wake me up any time to talk about it.

:bulb: Extremely curious, overzealous about tech, reads a tonne of multidisciplinary stuff, loves to help out when I can.
